# PES Data
This directory contains all the parent datasets used to create the state-specific files where size appropriate and the state data. 
- The orginal mobility 2019 data is not included here, but can be found at on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeoDS/COVID19USFlows). 
- The state-specific contact matrices come from the 'epydemix' package grouped by the 5 age-bins appropriate for US analyses, but further exploration of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix-data) and [here](https://www.epistorm.org/data/epistorm-mix).

We also include example templates in 'INPUT_TEMPLATES' for each model that can be modified by hand or with a script similar to how the state-specific files were created. See '../scripts/XXX.R' for further demonstration.

## Parent datasets

### Between Node Mobility Networks - `ct_ak_crosswalks.r` and `county_mobility_timeseries_post2020census.r` 
1. [Alaska](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.2010.html#list-tab-957819518) split one county into 2 in 2019, but this change was not commonly used until after the pandemic and 2020 census. We created this crosswalk manually by determining the proportion of the 2019-2023 ACS population in each new county (69% and 31% split). 
2. [Connecticut](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.January_2020.html) changed their county names and boundaries in 2023 to Planning Regions. [GeoCorr 2022](https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2022.html) provides crosswalks across US boundaries including a Connecticut pre-2023 boundary under "Other geographies". CT crosswalk in `post2020_county_mobility_flow/connecticut_county_crosswalk_geocorr2022.csv` and combined with AK in `post2020_county_mobility_flow/ak_ct_crosswalk.csv`
3. With the county crosswalk created, we translated each day of the 2019 Safegraph county mobility visits to 2023 census boundaries and reduced the data to only within-state pairs. The AK and CT conversion created some rounding errors in population increasing the total daily flow by 40-50 people. The estimated  population traveling each day far exceed the 2019-2023 census estimates of the population within each county, because cell-phone data captures flow of non-residents. We used the fraction of the total outflow per county to derive the proportions of the population traveling. We grouped travel by quarter of the year and provide all 4, but Q4 is likely the most appropriate for modeling the influenza season in the US. Future code iterations may allow daily mobility matrices, but currently an average one is used for the entire time series. We also provide a `county connection ranking` of the total people flowing out of a county each day to help target which counties may have the largest impact on the community when infections are seeded there. 


### High Risk Ratios - `Flu_HighRisk_by_AgeGrp.R`
1. [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm) is a continual survey released annually of Americans 18+ to estimate the proportion of the population experiencing comorbidities and taking part in risky behviors such as smoking. We use the [CDC's list of comorbidities](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm) that increase the risk of hospitalization and death for adults to pull out the proportion of the population with at least one comorbidity and do not scale risk by multiple comorbidities. Anyone 65+ is technically high risk due to age, but we leave this to the user and estimate comorbid risk for this age group the same as 18-49 and 49-64. Orginal data in `BRFSS/LLCP202*.XPT`, both 2022 and 2023 are needed because Kentucky and Pennsylvania did not collect enough data in 2023.
2. [National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.2023.html) surveys parents to assess the comorbidity burden of children 17 and under. The CDC provides a [seperate list of high risk comorbidities for children](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/neurologic-pediatric.html). Both BRFSS and NSCH provide the respondent's age group, current state, strata and primary sampling unit to allow for adjusted prevalance estimates. Orginal data in `NSCH/nsch_2023e_topical.sas7bdat`.
3. [Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) 2022 release](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/svi-data-documentation-download.html) is derived from the 5-year American Community Survey based on 16 factors that increase someone's likelihood of suffering or struggling to recover after a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or pandemic. It is a percentile rank that will always have a lowest vulnerability (0) and highest (1), so we use the US level ranking rather than state specific to compare the SVI at county-level to the CDC PLACES data below. Orginal data in `SVI_2022_US_county.csv`.
4. [CDC PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html) combines BRFSS, ACS and SVI with other datasets to generate county, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level estimates of the proportion of different comorbidities and risky behaviors. It does not provide the proportion of the population with at least 1 comorbidity at these granular levels. We combined the state and age-specific BRFSS/NSCH estimates with county-level comorbidity prevalence to create county-specfic high risk ratios per age group. We only kept comorbidities that linearly increased with SVI. Cancer prevalence was the only comorbidity negatively associated with SVI as it includes skin cancer, a disease typical of white, affluent people.
